	This is a Python and SQLite3 project. I created a text based UI for both customers and agent(administrator) to access a local database. This program is a simplified version of amazon. Customers can use this program to search for goods, view details of goods, place order and view its basket. Agent can use this program to manage orders, update details of store and their storage and so on.
